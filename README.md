# Hypothesis-Testing

### Chi-Square Test

The test is applied when you have two categorical variables from a single population. It is used to determine whether there is a significant association between the two variables.

### T Test
A t-test is a type of inferential statistic which is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups which may be related in certain features

T-test has 2 types : 1. one sampled t-test 2. two-sampled t-test.

### One-sample T-test

The test will tell us whether means of the sample and the population are different

### Two-sample T-test
The Independent Samples t Test or 2-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups in order to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the associated population means are significantly different. The Independent Samples t Test is a parametric test. This test is also known as: Independent t Test

### Paired T-test
When you want to check how different samples from the same group are, you can go for a paired T-test

### Anova Test(F-Test)
The t-test works well when dealing with two groups, but sometimes we want to compare more than two groups at the same time.
For example, if we wanted to test whether a numerical variable  differs based on some categorical variable, we have to compare the means of each  group of the categorical  variable

### One Way F-test(Anova)
It tell whether two or more groups are similar or not based on their mean similarity and f-score.

Example : there are 3 different category of iris flowers and their petal width and need to check whether all 3 group are similar or not
